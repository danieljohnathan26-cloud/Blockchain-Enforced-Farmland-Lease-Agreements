# 🌾 Blockchain-Enforced Farmland Lease Agreements

Welcome to a revolutionary way to manage farmland leases using blockchain technology! This Web3 project addresses real-world challenges in agriculture, such as disputes over lease terms, delayed payments, lack of transparency, and fraud in land dealings. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, landowners and farmers can create secure, automated, and immutable lease agreements that ensure fair dealings, automated payments, and easy verification.

## ✨ Features

🌍 Register and verify farmland ownership  
📝 Create customizable lease agreements with terms like duration, rent, and crop-sharing  
💰 Automated payment escrow and release based on milestones or conditions  
⚖️ Built-in dispute resolution via oracle integration  
📈 Tokenized yield sharing for sharecropping models  
🔒 Immutable audit trail for all transactions and modifications  
🚜 Marketplace for listing and discovering available farmlands  
✅ Compliance checks for regulatory requirements  
📊 Analytics dashboard for lease performance tracking  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project involves 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, ensuring modularity, security, and scalability. Here's a high-level overview:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **LandRegistry.clar**: Handles registration of farmland parcels with details like location (via geohash), size, and owner proofs. Prevents duplicate registrations and allows ownership transfers.  
2. **LeaseAgreement.clar**: Core contract for creating leases. Defines terms (e.g., start/end dates, rent amount, crop types) and enforces them automatically.  
3. **PaymentEscrow.clar**: Manages secure escrow for rent payments in STX or wrapped BTC. Releases funds on schedule or upon condition fulfillment (e.g., via oracle confirmation of crop harvest).  
4. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Integrates with external oracles for real-world data (e.g., weather events or yield reports) and allows arbitration through a DAO-like voting mechanism.  
5. **YieldToken.clar**: Tokenizes expected crop yields for sharecropping, allowing farmers to sell or trade shares pre-harvest.  
6. **Marketplace.clar**: A decentralized listing service where landowners can post available farmlands, and farmers can bid or apply for leases.  
7. **ComplianceChecker.clar**: Verifies regulatory compliance (e.g., environmental standards) using oracle-fed data before finalizing leases.  
8. **AuditTrail.clar**: Logs all interactions across contracts for transparency, enabling queries for historical data and dispute evidence.

**For Landowners**  
- Register your farmland using LandRegistry.clar with proof of ownership (e.g., hashed legal documents).  
- List it on Marketplace.clar with desired lease terms.  
- Once a farmer applies, deploy a LeaseAgreement.clar instance via a transaction.  
- Payments flow through PaymentEscrow.clar, auto-releasing based on time or oracle-verified conditions.  
- In case of disputes, invoke DisputeResolution.clar for fair adjudication.

**For Farmers**  
- Search Marketplace.clar for available lands and submit bids.  
- Sign the lease via LeaseAgreement.clar, depositing initial payments into escrow.  
- Use YieldToken.clar to tokenize and potentially monetize future yields.  
- ComplianceChecker.clar ensures the lease meets local regs before activation.  
- Access AuditTrail.clar for transparent records of all activities.

**For Verifiers or Regulators**  
- Query LandRegistry.clar to confirm ownership.  
- Use AuditTrail.clar to review lease history and compliance via ComplianceChecker.clar.  
- Verify payments and resolutions through the respective contracts.

That's it! With blockchain's immutability, this system reduces paperwork, minimizes trust issues, and automates enforcement—solving key pain points in global agriculture. Deploy on Stacks for Bitcoin-level security and low fees.
